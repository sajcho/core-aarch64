     !!! Warning !!!
     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  After upgrading to openssl3 bsdtar looks for openssl - pkgmk is broken.

  You must reinstall libarchive manually (configure, make, make install).

  Then pkgmk -u -f libarchive && revdep && reinstall all ports that refer to openssl.

  ###

  If you have the latest version of rootfs(20211118),
  you do not need to perform this action.
